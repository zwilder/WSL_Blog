# Wsl Blog

The source repository for the - dare I say, **magnificent** - wsl blog. I'm not
a web designer, by any stretch of the imagination. But, I like to make things,
and this is a thing I made.

The source files here are built with hugo into the zwilder/zwilder.github.io
repo - NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF: "hugo --directory zwilder.github.io"
