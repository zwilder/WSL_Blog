# Wsl Blog

The source repository and build directory for the - dare I say, **magnificent**
- wsl blog. I'm not a web designer, by any stretch of the imagination. But, I
like to make things, and this is a thing I made.

Note to myself - when cloning this repo in the future, src/static doesn't exist
but it needs to. Copy the docs/assets and docs/images directories into a
src/static directory
