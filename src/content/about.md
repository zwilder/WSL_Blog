title: About Wsl

## Who are you?

Well, I am just some guy with a computer and some free time - and I spend that
free time making things, exploring places, and "entertaining" family and
coworkers with stories.

Professionally, I work as a consulting utility forester, and am the area safety
representative for a large group of people over 5 states in the western US. I am
an ISA Certified Arborist, with (the majority of) my degree in Ecology from the
University of Arizona, and I am a veteran of the US Navy. During my time in the
Navy, I had the opportunity to work in a natural resources office doing trail
maintenance, planting trees, prescribed burns, and cleaning up roadkill.
Between the Navy and the UofA I worked many (many) odd jobs, always hoping to
end up working outside. At the UofA I worked as a research assistant catching
rodents and bats with the mammology department, and assisted the Tree Ring
Institute with modernizing the software used for tree ring analysis.

## What is "Wsl"?

It's short for "weasel". Most of my ideas began as inspiration gained from watching too many cartoons, this one was from Cow and Chicken. I've used it as
an abbreviation in my code for years now, prefacing classes and objects with it. Also, hilariously, it's the abbreviation for the World Surf League - which I am 100% not affiliated with, unless they want to hook me up with a t-shirt featuring a surfing mustelid or something.

## Who built this site? How?
I'm a hobbyist programmer, and have been messing around with various little
programming projects since I was a kid borrowing books on C programming from the
local library. I think I originally started programming because as a kid I had
no way of actually buying computer games, and figured "heck, I could make
something myself!" 

I built this site, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fantastic static blog
generator. The theme
is a heavily modified version of [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin).
The source for the site is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/zwilder/). I do all my work on an old laptop or a computer I built running [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), writing everything
in [Vim](https://www.vim.org).  If anything is broken on the site and needs
fixing please don't hesitate to [email me](mailto:z@wsl-blog.com)!
