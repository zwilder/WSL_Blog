title: About the Wsl
---

## Who are you?

Well, I am just some guy with a computer and some free time - and I spend that
free time making things, exploring places, and "entertaining" family and
coworkers with stories.

Professionally, I work as a senior consulting utility forester. I am an ISA
Certified Arborist/Utility Specialist, with (the majority of) my degree in
Ecology from the University of Arizona, and I am a veteran of the US Navy. 

## What is "Wsl"?

It's short for "weasel". Most of my ideas began as inspiration gained from
watching too many cartoons, this one was from Cow and Chicken. I've used it as
an abbreviation in my code for years now, prefacing classes and objects with it.
Also, hilariously, it's the abbreviation for the World Surf League - which I am
100% not affiliated with, unless they want to hook me up with a t-shirt
featuring a surfing mustelid or something.

## Who built this site? How?
I'm a hobby programmer, and have been messing around with various little
programming projects since I was a kid borrowing books on C programming from the
local library. I think I originally started programming because as a kid I had
no way of actually buying computer games, and figured "heck, I could make
something myself!" 

I built this site, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fantastic static blog
generator. The theme is a heavily modified version of
[XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin). The lightbox code for the images is
provided by [Fancybox](https://github.com/fancyapps/fancybox). The source for
the site is posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/zwilder/WSL_Blog).  If
anything is broken on the site and needs fixing please don't hesitate to leave
a comment and let me know!
