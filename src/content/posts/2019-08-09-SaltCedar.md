# Background

 *Tamarix ramosissima* is one of several types of salt cedar in Arizona. It is
common along river beds and riparian areas and is considered a [pioneer
species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_species) (a hardy plant that is
first to colonize a disturbed area). Salt cedar grows in areas where native
trees and shrubs can't survive or are no longer suitable for their habitation.
These native trees, like cottonwoods and willows, have evolved to reproduce
after yearly flooding has occurred. In many areas this periodic flooding no
longer occurs and this has paved the way for salt cedars, which can produce seed
year around [(UA
News)](https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/study-finds-silver-lining-for-maligned-saltcedar).

It has long been thought that salt cedar crowds out native species. In many
areas where salt cedar has taken over, the soils  have high salinity, low water
availability, and are often higher in nutrients and organic matter. Salt cedar
prefers areas where the streamflow has  been altered by dams, often creating
this type of environment where salt, nutrients, and organic matter have not been
flushed out of the soil by periodic flooding. Salt cedar can be found with
sandbar willow (*Salix exigua*),  Fremont cottonwood (*Populus fremontii*), and
boxelder (*Acer negundo*).

**Salt cedar is halophytic** - it is adapted to living in a saline environment
and it has the ability to sequester salt in its tissues. It can also secrete
salt from microscopic glands on the underside of the leaves: 

>One winter, I was patrolling power lines near the Gila River, south of Phoenix
>and I came across an area that was thick with salt cedar and the right-of-way
>was becoming engulfed. I had to drive through the overgrown right-of-way and
>the branches grazing my truck were damp with morning dew. It was a cool morning
>and all the windows were up on my truck but once I got through the area I
>noticed a white "film" all over the windows, I had to stop and wipe/scrape it
>off because once it dried I could no longer see out! It was salty water exuded
>from the salt cedars. At one point I had to walk through the wet brush - I
>didn't really think anything of it but once my clothes dried my pants and
>jacket were covered in white residue from the salty dew. It really does pull
>salt out of the ground and secrete it through the salt glands. This was in
>December and in some areas it looked like it had just snowed because of the
>salt on top of the soil.

*Tamarix spp.* (spp. = several species) produce an abundance of seeds. One tree
can produce 500,000 seeds per year or more, and the tree flowers in its first
year. If roots or stems are cut, they will readily grow back.

There are some **massive** tamarisk trees around - these are a different species
than the more invasive *T. ramosissima*. These large trees are *Tamarix aphylla*
Athel tamarisk. To make things a bit confusing - they are also called salt
cedar. The Athel tamarisk is not invasive, but it is a very fast grower when
young and can reach 60' tall with the same size canopy. The huge trunk and
branches can form a maze and the dense shade provides locals much needed relief
from the summer sun. I've come across many urban outdoorsmen who have found
respite in the shade of the Althel tamarisk.

# Identification

*T. ramosissima* has very small overlapping scale-like leaves, similar to
juniper or cypress.  You can barely see the leaves. When young they can have a
reddish twig. Salt cedars are deciduous but appear evergreen because of the very
small leaves. The flowers are in clusters and range from white to pink, they
have a small tuft of fuzz on the end which helps dispersal by wind. You can tell
this species apart from salt cedars because of the 5 toothed
[sepals](https://biologydictionary.net/sepal/).

The sturdy Athel tamarisk with its graceful and somewhat weeping habit is
noticeable from a distance. it is more common in less populated areas of the
city, where there is space for it to spread out. The bark of older trees is
deeply furrowed.
