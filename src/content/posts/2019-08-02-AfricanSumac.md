# Background

*Sersia lancea*, the African sumac, is a common tree around the valley - the
strong fragrance of its diminuitive flowers remind me strongly of spring time as
a kid growing up in Phoenix. The tree is relatively unassuming, no showy flowers
in the spring and no vibrant colours in the fall. Like most invading trees, it was
originally brought to the valley in the 60s as a landscape tree. I'd venture to
guess that most homes built in the 60s and early 70s had an African sumac
planted prominently in the front yard or back yard.

As can probably be deducted from the common name, it is one of the most common
trees in South Africa. In the native range, livestock that graze too heavily on
the leaves will develop a foul taste in their milk. The bark, leaves, and twigs
provided indigenous groups with a valuable source of tannin for leather making.
The sumac's hard wood was used for making bows and weaponry, and also as
fenceposts - and it's easy to see why when looking at the long, slender water sprouts.

The African sumac is in the Anarcadiacea family, which is the same family as
cashews, mangos, pistachios, and poison ivy. I've read in various online sources
hints that the peppercorns of the African sumac have been used as a spice, and
even used as one of the main ingredients in a type of honey mead - although
despite my best googling I was unable to find more information to back up this
claim. 

The African sumac's botanical name, *Sersia lancea*, was formally *Rhus lancea*.
Rhus is the latin word for sumac, and lancea was a type of spear used by Roman
infantry - a reference to the shape of the leaflets. The tree was formally
renamed to Sersia in the early 90s in honor of the botanist and author [Paul B.
Sears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sears). 

The tree is very easily propogated by the peppercorn-like seeds, which is a
problem because birds **love** these seeds. So, naturally, in any area in
Phoenix where there is water, you'll see these trees sprout up. Unlike the [lead
tree](/posts/2019-07-19-leadtree/), they don't grow excessively fast, and they do not reach maturity and
start producing pods as rapidly. If there is a regular source of water, like a
drainage ditch or desert wash, these trees will establish themselves and easily
crowd out the much slower growing native vegetation.

# Identification

*Sersia lancea*, in the Phoenix area, is an evergreen tree, that usually grows
to be between 20ft and 25ft (6 to 8m) tall. It will, however, with regular
water (like in a grassy lawn or with flood irrigation) grow **much** larger -
easily surpassing 30ft (9m) tall.

The easiest way I've found to identify this tree is by its leaves. It is by
far the most common tree in the valley with trifoliate leaves, which to me look
like chicken feet. The leaflet margins (edges) are entire (smooth), the top of
the leaves are dark olive green, and the bottoms are a pale olive green. During
the warm summer months the tree will shed an almost obscene amount of dry, dead
leaves. 

The bark of this tree is usually rough and fissured, with younger wood being
smooth and light brownish grey. The flowers are small and unassuming, and branch
out diagonally from the stems amoung the foliage and on the ends (axillary and
terminal). The flowers have a distinct fragrence, sweet and warm. The seeds are
technically a drupe, and are usually seen as clusters of white peppercorns
(don't eat them!).

There aren't too many trees that look similar to this tree - although at a
casual glance it could be mistaken for a willow acacia (*Acacia salicinia*). The
leaves of the willow acacia look very much like the leaflets of the African
sumac - but that's about it. Willow acacias are usually much taller, and have a
much more upright form than the usual splayed out form of the African sumac.
